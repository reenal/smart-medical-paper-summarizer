        "Cohere": "Title: Adjunctive beneficial effect of c-di-GMP, a STING agonist, in enhancing protective efficacy of TLR4-adjuvanted tuberculosis subunit vaccine formulations  \nAuthors: Kee Woong Kwon, Eunsol Choi, Hagyu Kim, Hyeong Woo Kim, Sangwon Choi, Seunghyun Lee, Sang-Jun Ha, and Sung Jae Shin  \n\nSummary:  \nThis study investigates the potential of combining Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) adjuvants with a stimulator of interferon genes (STING) agonist, c-di-GMP (CDG), to enhance the protective efficacy of tuberculosis (TB) subunit vaccines. The research focuses on the immunogenicity of antigens (Ags) ESAT6 and Ag85B when formulated with TLR4 adjuvants (MPL/DDA or GLA-SE) and CDG. Mice immunized with these formulations exhibited increased generation of Th1-biased, polyfunctional ESAT6- and Ag85B-specific CD4+ T cells in both the lungs and spleen. The inclusion of CDG promoted the mucosal localization of these T cells, resembling resident memory phenotypes in the lung parenchyma, and increased their presence in lung vasculature.  \n\nFollowing aerogenic challenge with *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* (Mtb), immunized mice showed significantly reduced bacterial loads and pulmonary inflammation compared to non-immunized, BCG-immunized, and GLA-SE-only immunized groups. Notably, CDG inclusion decreased the expression of killer cell lectin-like receptor subfamily G member 1 (KLRG1) among Ag-specific CD4+ T cells, correlating with enhanced lung-homing and the presence of less-differentiated Th1 cells.  \n\nThe findings highlight that CDG, when combined with TLR4 adjuvants, enhances long-term protective immunity, offering a promising strategy for developing more effective TB subunit vaccines. This approach addresses the critical need for improved TB vaccines by leveraging adjuvant synergy to optimize immune responses against Mtb.",

The researchers found that integrating ESAT6 antigen in TLR4 and CDG adjuvant formulations remarkably boosted Th1-biased, polyfunctional ESAT6-specific CD4+ T cells in the lungs and spleen, providing durable protection against Mtb infection. The inclusion of CDG promoted mucosal localization of ESAT6-specific CD4+ T cells resembling resident memory phenotypes in the lung parenchyma and increased Ag-specific CD4+ T cells in lung vasculature. Immunization with another vaccine Ag candidate, Ag85B, in GLA-SE plus CDG similarly increased Ag85B-specific CD4+ T cells in the spleen and both lung compartments. Following ultra-low dose Mtb challenge, ESAT6 or Ag85B/GLA-SE/CDG immunizations significantly reduced bacterial loads compared to non-, Bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG)-, and ESAT6 or Ag85B/GLA-SE-immunized groups. The study highlights that CDG, when used in combination with TLR4 adjuvants, enhances long-term protective immunity, offering a promising strategy for subunit TB vaccine development.",

The integration of these components was found to significantly boost Th1-biased, polyfunctional adaptive immune responses, and increase the localization of these specific T cells in lung tissue. Consequently, this provided durable protection against infection from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the bacteria causing TB. The study emphasizes the enhanced long-term protective immunity provided by the STING agonist c-di-GMP when combined with TLR4 adjuvants, indicating a promising path for subunit TB vaccine development."
