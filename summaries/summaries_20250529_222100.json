        "Cohere": "Title: Adjunctive beneficial effect of c-di-GMP, a STING agonist, in enhancing protective efficacy of TLR4-adjuvanted tuberculosis subunit vaccine formulations  \nAuthors: Kee Woong Kwon  \n\nSummary:  \nKee Woong Kwon's research investigates the potential of c-di-GMP, a STING (stimulator of interferon genes) agonist, to enhance the protective efficacy of tuberculosis (TB) subunit vaccines adjuvanted with TLR4. The study focuses on improving vaccine formulations against *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*, the causative agent of TB, by leveraging the immunomodulatory properties of c-di-GMP.  \n\nKey findings highlight that c-di-GMP, when combined with TLR4 adjuvants, significantly boosts the immune response to TB subunit vaccines. This combination enhances the activation of innate immune pathways, leading to improved antigen presentation and T-cell responses. Specifically, the addition of c-di-GMP promotes the production of protective cytokines and increases the population of lung-resident memory T cells, which are critical for long-term immunity against TB.  \n\nThe study underscores the potential of c-di-GMP as an adjuvant to optimize TB vaccine formulations, addressing the limitations of current TB vaccines like BCG. By demonstrating the synergistic effects of STING and TLR4 agonists, the research provides valuable insights for the development of more effective TB vaccines. The findings have significant implications for global TB control efforts, particularly in regions with high disease burden.  \n\nIn summary, Kwon's work establishes c-di-GMP as a promising adjunct to enhance the protective efficacy of TLR4-adjuvanted TB subunit vaccines, offering a novel strategy to combat this persistent global health challenge.",
