        "Cohere": "Title: Adjunctive beneficial effect of c-di-GMP, a STING agonist, in enhancing protective efficacy of TLR4-adjuvanted tuberculosis subunit vaccine formulations  \nAuthors: Kee Woong Kwon  \n\nSummary:  \nThis research investigates the potential of c-di-GMP, a STING (Stimulator of Interferon Genes) agonist, to enhance the protective efficacy of TLR4-adjuvanted tuberculosis subunit vaccine formulations. Tuberculosis (TB), caused by *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*, remains a global health challenge, with existing vaccines like BCG showing variable efficacy. The study focuses on improving vaccine effectiveness by combining TLR4 adjuvants with c-di-GMP to bolster immune responses.  \n\nKey findings reveal that the addition of c-di-GMP significantly enhances the protective efficacy of TLR4-adjuvanted subunit vaccines. This combination stimulates robust immune responses, including the activation of protective pulmonary CD4+ T cells and the production of cytokines such as IL-23 and IL-17, which are critical for defense against TB. The study also highlights the role of c-di-GMP in promoting trained immunity and lung-resident memory T cell populations, which are essential for long-term protection.  \n\nThe significance of these findings lies in their potential to improve TB vaccine formulations, offering a more effective and durable immune response against *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*. This research contributes to the development of novel TB vaccines by demonstrating the synergistic benefits of combining STING agonists with TLR4 adjuvants, addressing a critical gap in current TB prevention strategies.",

The researchers found that the combination of c-di-GMP and TLR4-adjuvanted subunit vaccine formulations significantly increased the protective efficacy against Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection in mice. The study highlights the potential of c-di-GMP as a novel adjuvant for tuberculosis vaccines, which could improve the immune response and provide better protection against the disease. The findings of this study have significant implications for the development of more effective tuberculosis vaccines.\n\nDocument Context:\nThe provided document metadata suggests that the paper is a research article published in the Journal of Biomedical Science, with a DOI of 10.1186/s12929-025-01144-8. The paper appears to be a comprehensive review of the literature on tuberculosis vaccines, with a focus on the role of c-di-GMP as a STING agonist and its potential as an adjuvant for tuberculosis vaccines. The document metadata also includes a list of references cited in the paper, which suggests that the authors have conducted a thorough review of the existing literature on the topic.\n\nKey Findings:\nThe study found that the combination of c-di-GMP and TLR4-adjuvanted subunit vaccine formulations significantly increased the protective efficacy against Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection in mice. The researchers also found that c-di-GMP enhanced the immune response by increasing the production of cytokines and activating immune cells.\n\nSignificance:\nThe findings of this study have significant implications for the development of more effective tuberculosis vaccines. The use of c-di-GMP as an adjuvant could improve the immune response and provide better protection against the disease. The study highlights the potential of c-di-GMP as a novel adjuvant for tuberculosis vaccines, which could lead to the development of more effective vaccines against tuberculosis.",
